      The aim of this project is to work out the diagnosis by calculating the probability of various diseases given a set of radiological findings. 
Naturally Bay`s theorem could be used to calculate the probabilities. Baye`s theorem asserts that the probability of a disease can be calculated if we know the prevalence of the disease in the society and the conditional probability of the radiological sign given that disease.  The conditional probability of the sign given the disease is simply the sensitivity of that sign to the disease. In other words, if we know the sensitivities of the different radiological signs in different diseases, we can calculate the probability of each disease given a particular set of radiological signs.

  Where prevalence i is the frequency of the disease (i), producti is the multiplication of the sensitivities of all findings already exist in our query case for the disease and finally N is the total number of diseases.
However, two potentials drawbacks may arise when strictly applying the above equation:
Firstly, suppose one or more findings in our query case is not normally associated with a particular disease (literally the sensitivity of those findings=0) what will be the probability of that disease given those findings? Well, the nominator in the above equation becomes zero because at least one sensitivity of those findings will be equal to zero leading to a zero  probability. But having a zero probability of a disease is not a generally desirable thing. So we require that the probability of all diseases can not be zero.
Secondly, suppose on the other hand that our query case has no particular finding that happens to be so specific for a particular disease, wouldn't it intuitively mean that the odds of that disease is reduced when that specific variable does not exist in our query case?  Obviously the above formula does not reflect that requirement either.
To overcome these problems, the following modification is introduced where the the producti is replaced by:

  Where presentj is a just number corresponding to the sensitivity of the findings given the disease such that it takes a very small number not equal to zero for those findings with zero sensitivities. absentj is a modulator number corresponding to the absence of the findings and r is the number of variables. That modular number is a function of the sensitivity of the radiological finding and the total number of the disease. It approaches 1 for non-specific findings but becomes less than 1 for specific findings. The way of calculating the modular number requires the concept of entropy from the information theory.
The status of presence and absence of the variable in our query case is just (1 and 0), respectively. 
You see that this trick can not null the product in the previous formula because even if one of the diseases has no such variable (presentj =small number not equal to 0) the product will still be greater than 0 which satisfies the first requirement in the previous paragraph. On the other hand, when the query case has no such variable that is specific to a particular disease the modulator number absentj will reduce the probability of that disease as desired by the second requirement. 
The final step is renormalization to allow the completeness of the data space which means the sum of the probabilities of all disorders =1.
